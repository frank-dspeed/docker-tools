# ddocker ip  - parm = containerid/name gets the ip 
# ddocker gnet. imagename gets ips and hostname ?ports from all containers running that image
# 
# ddocker gkill- kills all containers running a spezifed image
#
# Planed ddocker %docker comannd against a group of containers by running imagename
#
# ddocker cinstall containerid - will allow you to install docker-tools in the container it 
#                               makes a image from the container then makes new image and installs docker-tools

# ddocker cinst - Adds files from host to docker container via rebuilding 
# ddocker expose- exposes network info to net_info file
# ddocker info  - copys _info files out of it into a directory on host containerid/ folder files_info stores info files ;)
# ddocker ginfo  - copys _info files out of it into a directory on host containerid/ folder files_info stores info files ;)
# ddocker ainfo  - copys _info files out of it into a directory on host containerid/ folder files_info stores info files ;)

# ddocker commit - parms image, cmd, // runs image with cmd and commits the result to image

# ddocker clean - clean several modes
#
# on host create docker_container_infos/$HOSTNAME.imagename.ip._info
# on host check if infos are valid against docker ps if not mov to docker_container_infos_deleted/* only move none existing containers!
#
# infos to store: docker inspect, docker diff timestemped, _info files timestemped ln -s current
# schedule info files and diff snapshoting. and check process overall
